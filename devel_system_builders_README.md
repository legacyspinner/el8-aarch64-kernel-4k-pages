EL8 aarch64 kernel with 4K cpu pages enabled. 
*Warning: This is only intented for testing as I built it with kabichk disabled.

I made this to test on the apple m1 with UTM with 'hypervisor' set to on.
The machine  expects 4K or 16K pages but the default in el8 is detected as 64K.


Compile your own with:
<code>
rpmbuild -bb --target=$(uname -m) kernel.spec --without debug --without debuginfo --without kabichk kernel.spec 2> build-err.log | tee build-out.log
</code>

*Note: patches have been included for testing seperate but are already in the SRPM/Source.
Debug patch included too incase you want to rebuild with that enabled.

*Its unrelated to the rebuilt kernel-4k itself, but as a pre-req I should mention for anyone else trying
to rebuild/clone. 

The build host for this subproject:
Built on rocky-8.x minimal, that was upgraded to later versions. 
For now, I'm((all me im sure, TM) having issues with 'initial' rocky-aarch64-min iso installs 
on rocky spins>8.x   ***Someone else suggested it might be a ks issue.
IDK, yet. It could also be an issue with my aarch64-kvmhost or unknown.


Subject to change:
*Here's what I will say for now about starting with aarch64 iso's and me:
Works, doesnt mean I tested everything, just means it booted/installed and then booted again.

8.3 works: INITRAMFS OK! but is a known dev version with warnings in "ISSUE"-DO NOT START/BUILD WITH/FROM THIS ONE

8.4 works: INITRAMFS OK! older release, newer working for 'me'

8.5 works: INITRAMFS OK! Working.Minimal Issues

8.6 works: INITRAMFS OK! Works for me but console can detach.

*Note: ALMA 8.7 #1 on alma also fails, with a different error:
<code> error: ../../grub-core/kern/disk_common.c:47:attempt to read or write outside
of disk `cd0'.
error: ../../grub-core/loader/arm64/linux.c:304:you need to load the kernel</code>

Alma 8.7 has another iso: AlmaLinux-8.7-update-1-aarch64-minimal.iso
*That one fails for me with the same error in rocky 8.7

*You can use a earlier ISO and just upgrade it.
